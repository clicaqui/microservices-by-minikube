# microservices-by-minikube

Source code updated to work without OpenShift and run in the Minikube Cluster accomplish with few modifications.

For use in development, the current model presents a vulnerability that does not follow good practices in the use of Kubernetes and so I developed this code model for the correct use of the creation of microservices in the Minikube.
